This is just a very basic presentation about user experience for the first workshop on experience design.

I've used Reveal.js on top of a Sinatra app using Slim abstraction. Neat.

Installation should be very straightforward:

$ bundle install

$ bundle exec ruby app.rb -p 3000

After that you should be able to see the presentation on http://localhost:3000/
